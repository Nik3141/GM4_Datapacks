**Module** Wandistry

**Main Feature** Adds a wand item which can be used to craft spells, which are added in expansion packs.

**User Experience**
 - To craft a wand, players need a wand tip and a resonant core.
 - One resonant core can be found in an ancient temple, which is a new generated structure.
 - A resonant core can also be crafted with a nether star, four blaze rods, two end rods, and two sticks:

 - A wand tip is made of four quartz and a diamond.

   - Q -
 -This wand can be used to cast spells by moving the wand up, down, left, and right, which come in the standard spells pack.
